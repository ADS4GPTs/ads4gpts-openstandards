# ADS4GPTs - Open Standards

**Bringing Ad Standards into the AI Era**  

**ADS4GPTs - Open Standards** is an open-source initiative dedicated to elevating the existing Advertising standards for AI Native Advertising. Our goal is to define specifications, protocols, and conceptual frameworks that empower AI applications to seamlessly interact with advertising ecosystems while adhering to industry best practices.

---

## 🚀 Mission

**ADS4GPTs - Open Standards**  provides a robust foundation for AI-driven advertising by:

- Establishing AI-focused Ad specifications.
- Defining protocols to ensure seamless AI-advertiser interactions.
- Outlining conceptual frameworks for ad delivery, measurement, and compliance in AI environments.

## 🧠 Philosophy

The digital media landscape is shifting from static content to AI-driven interactions through chatbots, autonomous agents, and dynamic applications, requiring a reevaluation of traditional advertising protocols that rely on user tracking and invasive data collection. At ADS4GPTs, the focus is on transforming the advertising landscape alongside these shifts, moving from static digital content to AI applications, chatbots, and agents. Traditional protocols no longer meet the needs of such autonomous systems, so this project builds on permissioned marketing and takes it further by integrating advanced AI technologies with established standards.

Not only AI Native applications can benefit from the ADS4GPTs architecture. Even traditional media and digital Ad placements can adopt our philosophy and approach.

ADS4GPTs introduces a paradigm shift in digital advertising by:

- Leveraging AI to understand user intent rather than tracking behavior
- Implementing permissioned marketing principles at the protocol level
- Enabling contextual ad matching without compromising privacy
- Creating standardized interfaces between AI systems and ad networks

### Core Architectural Evolution

Below is a visual representation of the evolution from traditional advertising architectures to our new AI-driven approach:

![Old vs New Architecture](Drafts/img/newvsold.png)

- **Old Architecture**: Supply side provides an impression request with as much invasive information that it seems highly valuable from the demand side and bid high.
- **New Architecture**: Supply side understands the needs of the user and requests the relevant Ads from the available advertisers. 

With GPT Ads and AI agents becoming the new interface for interacting with the Internet, the existing AdTech ecosystem is poised for significant transformation. Here's how we envision the transformation:

### Supply-Side Platforms (SSPs)
- Evolve into AI integration hubs
- Develop proprietary Ad Agents and offer them as a Service
- Focus on daily operational support
- Aggregate intelligence from Ad Agent interactions
- Minimum bid optimization

### Demand-Side Platforms (DSPs) 
- Optimize bidding mechanisms for AI environments
- Provide real-time performance analytics
- Bidding and budget optimization

### Ad Exchanges 
- Establish trust frameworks for AI-driven exchanges
- Support seamless advertiser-AI communication


In the following architectural diagram you see a version of this vision:
